When enough fail a trial within a <a data-href="Looking Glass" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Looking Glass</a>, a Teves will emerge, fully formed, mature, and with basic knowledge of the surrounding area.Their hair colors can fall within any fox, human, or goblin range, however, their hair ages much like a Human's, becoming lighter before becoming darker, stabilizing for some time before becoming grey.Teves are each ageless, not being harmed by the passage of time, but are certainly capable of being killed.They know as much about their own creation as the other races do, and though they have a penchant for deceit, lies, and acting as if they know more than they do, they don't. Anyone who gets to know one will soon find that out.They possess many enigmatic abilities and traits (and I am looking to add more odd options if anyone has suggestions), which they can not explain and some don't even understand.They are a minority in almost any society they find themselves in, though a few have begun to work on founding their own nation in secret.Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (about 4-6 feet tall)
Speed: 30 feetYou have eight traits chosen from the below list.The luck you carry will see you through the worst Etharis has to offer.

If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on the reroll made with Lucky.You draw your foes' attention to you, intending it to be the last diversion they ever see. As an Influence action, you put on a tactical display (bravado, cowardice, confusion, or some other tactic) that gets your enemies' attention. Until the end of your next turn, any attack on an enemy within 10 feet of you that could see you when you took the Influence action, is made with Advantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.Hindering Distraction. If you take this trait twice, when you use Master of Distraction, one affected enemy of your choice also has Disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against any of your allies until the end of your next turn.Your corporeal presence shifts and fades, softening your enemies' ability to harm you. As a Bonus Action, for 1 minute, all creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you can move through other creature's spaces without treating them as Difficult Terrain. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.Phase Shift.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.Blessed Hands. If you take this trait twice, your pool is equal to your level times your proficiency bonus.Sleep is a luxury you've never needed to afford. When you rest, you meditate deeply for 4 hours, dreaming but remaining conscious. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other humanoids do from 8 hours of sleep.Restorative Rest. If you take this trait twice, you need to spend only 2 hours in your meditation to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep, and you gain a d6 at the end of each Long Rest. Before the end of your next Long Rest, you can roll the d6 and add it to any d20 Test you make. You can decide to roll the d6 after the d20 Test is made, but you must do so before the outcome of the roll is known.As a Bonus Action, you can embrace your connection to the Hungering Ones beyond the reflections. Until the start of your next turn, you know the location of any creatures that aren't Constructs or Undead within 60 feet of yourself, and your attack rolls against those creatures can't have Disadvantage.

You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.

If you take this trait twice, while shape-shifted with this trait, you have Advantage on Charisma checks.You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices.

Their average lifespan of a Goblin who has yet to go through a <a data-href="Looking Glass" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Looking Glass</a> is about three years. They have a strange relationship with the Looking Glasses, as they seem to uniquely extend their lifespans by roughly a year each time they go into one.Goblins fully mature within the first six months of their life, it is during this time that they will usually adapt to their environment, and it is during this time that they consider themselves to be in great pain, as they grow rapidly to their adult size and proportions. They don't really age beyond this point, simply ceasing within the next four years.They uniquely don't raise their young, letting them fend for themselves a mere five days after they are born, being equivalent to a Human six year old already. They are definitely an R-selected species.Most of their education comes from intuition and oral mythologies and histories. Very few goblins ever have formal training, a Goblin Wizard would be considered a savant or a genius by the standards of the other races, for they just understand the nature of the universe.They are the only race that has near universally gone into the Looking Glasses, not only due to the life extending properties, but due to a pull towards them. A pull towards one’s suited to their particular environmental adaptations specifically. The cause is unknown, but they, even the logically minded of them, tend to take it as a spiritual or religious sign of some sort.Due to their short lifespans, they view time very differently to other races. Usually getting an intuitive grasp that their actions will have consequences down the line or a belief that every other race is ‘slow’, all talk and no action, wasting their time ‘relaxing’ rather than getting things done. Why sit and talk out the minutia of a plan when the plan isn’t going to go to plan anyways? Oddly a race of broad strokes, but a line of broad strokes, where the brush is never lifted off of the canvas of experience. If they can help it anyways. So, while you or I may call them impulsive or chaotic, they have already grasped something beyond our perspective and have decided to act on it.Their race is oddly spiritual, thousands of religions among their people, yet, their macro details are often similar. Making them simultaneously the most and least diverse peoples when it comes to religion.Goblins are, generally speaking, nomads, outlanders, or hermits. They rarely situate themselves properly into the societies of other races, rather 'passing through'.Goblins are usually some shade of green, however, they do have differences between different environments, though a vast majority are basically small green humans with long pointed ears, green skin, green eyes, extremely dark (almost black) green hair. Though some Goblins who have adapted extremely to an environment may look different.Arctic Goblins may be pale or white, they may even be furred.Coastal Goblins may have a more 'seafoam' coloration with shorter ears.Desert Goblins may have brown and tan colorations, longer ears not being uncommon, some of them even have neck frills. A few are even red, or their ears being with red accents or 'droopy bits'.Forest Goblins may have stripes or spots, their arms tend to be oddly longer in proportion to their bodies, and they may claws.Grassland Goblins may have a tan or golden tint to their skin, their legs tend to be oddly longer in proportion to their bodies, and their ears may be moveable much like a cat's.Hill and Mountain Goblins tend to be tough, skin taking on the texture and coloration of the stones they grew up near.Swamp Goblins tend to be darker colors, usually still green.Subterranean Goblins tend to be pale colors, with large eyes, some have small claws or strong grips.Underwater Goblins tend to grow gills, webbed digits, some even develop countershading, patterns like light through water, and are often blue or greys, and many develop maws filled with saw-like teeth like a shark. They tend to have ears that are even smaller than a Human's.Creature Type: Humanoid
